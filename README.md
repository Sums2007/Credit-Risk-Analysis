# Credit-Risk-Analysis

Introduction : 
This project aims to build and evaluate a credit risk classification model using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers and predict the risk of loan default.

Dataset :
The dataset consists of the following features:

loan_size: The size of the loan

interest_rate: The interest rate of the loan

borrower_income: The income of the borrower

debt_to_income: The ratio of the borrower's debt to their income
num_of_accounts: The number of accounts the borrower has
derogatory_marks: The number of derogatory marks on the borrower's credit history
total_debt: The total debt of the borrower
loan_status: The target variable, indicating whether the loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1)
Steps
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Load the dataset
Explore the dataset structure and statistics
Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
2. Feature Engineering
Scale the numerical features using StandardScaler
3. Handling Imbalanced Data
Oversample the minority class (high-risk loans) using SMOTE
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Split the resampled data into train and test sets
Train a logistic regression model on the training data
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using classification report and confusion matrix
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Perform grid search cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the logistic regression model
6. Model Comparison
Train a random forest classifier
Calculate and compare the ROC AUC scores of logistic regression and random forest
7. Model Interpretability
Calculate and print the feature importances using permutation importance
8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate a correlation matrix to visualize feature relationships
Create a box plot for outlier detection
9. Feature Selection
Compute mutual information between features and the target variable
Select the top k features based on mutual information scores
10. Ensemble Methods (XGBoost)
Train an XGBoost classifier
Evaluate the XGBoost model's performance using the classification report
11. Hyperparameter Tuning (XGBoost)
Perform randomized search cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model
12. Cross-Validation
Perform 5-fold cross-validation for the logistic regression model
Print the cross-validation scores and the mean score
13. Final Outcome
Select the best-performing model (tuned XGBoost)
Make predictions on the test data
Print the final classification report
Results
The final classification report shows that the tuned XGBoost model achieves an accuracy of 1.00 and perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores for both the healthy loan and high-risk loan classes. This indicates that the model is highly effective in predicting credit risk and identifying potential loan defaults.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating a credit risk classification model. It covers various techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling imbalanced data, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, and model interpretation. The use of advanced algorithms like XGBoost and thorough evaluation metrics showcase the ability to tackle complex problems and find the best-performing model for the given task.
